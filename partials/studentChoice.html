                    Capcom teams up with Armature Studio to focus on translating a
                    third-person console shooter into a first-person headset-based game
                    using the Oculus Quest. This nostalgic game has been given an
                    enhanced tune-up with being gifted the innovation of putting VR with
                    this game. This is a horror game that allows those playing it to now
                    be within the realm of zombies. You are still playing as Leon S.
                    Kennedy, now a U.S. government agent in rural Europe to rescue the
                    president’s daughter while fending off hordes of infected villagers
                    and monsters. From grabbing guns and shooting them to interacting
                    with how fast you are running and various obstacles to jump/climb.
                    combat is tactile and satisfying without being punishingly difficult
                    or complicated. It uses the original’s familiar outlay of handguns,
                    long guns, and a knife for close-range fighting.

        <h2>Why is it a good use of AR/VR?</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-6">
                <p>
                    Though entertainment is the main push for the remake of this game,
                    this is one of the first games by the company that made a VR version
                    of this game. Those who are fans of this franchise know that RE4VR
                    (Resident Evil 4 VR) is only an escalation for horror game scene.
                    The overwhelming graphics and interactions create a more intense
                    setting, making for the user to feel the full potential of being
                    scared. It's a vital use of VR by the way the game drags you into
                    the setting of the game, making you feel like you're really there.
                    Moreover, the game has different scenes where you, the player (named
                    Leon) are put in front of crucial decision making scenarios. Whether
                    its different puzzles to be completed or doing coop teammwork with
                    the AI within the game, there are various physics in the game where
                    normally doing with a controller doesn't help to feel the full
                    effect. Having VR incorporated within a game such as this will be
                    able to capture the player's intended actions based on behavior.
                    Meaning if a user is truly scared in a certain situation, they may
                    turn around and run. Or maybe they may get frozen in fear, not
                    knowing how to react quickly enough, giving it a more realistic
                    response to the game. The creators want you to feel like this is
                    your reality. The more important reasons for this game being made
                    into VR is to give a new twist to their games. After switching the
                    POV of the player and remaking several games into different types of
                    campaigns, Capcom felt the need to create something entirely
                    different for the players. Bringing back one of the fan favorites,
                    RE4 will now be a total immersion of a zombie ridden town having you
                    fight for your survival with critical decision making.

        <h2 style="text-align: center">Intended Demographic</h2>

        <p>
            Not only are the fans of Resident Evil pysched about the addition of VR, but so are VR gamers that are into
            horror games looking to get a good jump scare in. The audience has expanded solely due to the new
            implementation of the old game, enhancing the entertaintment altogether. Those who seem to find themselves
            enjoying a good scare and horror games in general will end up really liking this one. The rated Mature game
            targets the older teen/20 year olds that are able to handle the gore that it provides. With the occasional
            cussing and remarks made throughout the game, the audience is expected to be professional in this setting,
            considering now YOU are the one retreiving the president’s daughter, not a third-person version of you...
            the stakes are much higher. The game has hidden treasures throughout it, and someone who has a keen eye or
            sharp sense of decision making would be well fit for the task at hand. Players are expected to solve riddles
            and in-game puzzles in order to have them progress within the game, so pay attention to your surroundings.
            The VR aspect will shape the audience into being someone that is prepared for any danger. Quick thinking
            will help you escape to safety, so be smart on top of your game.

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Pros</h2>
                <li>
                    'Full Motion' - a mode made for experienced VR gamers whole like
                    control
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Comfort Mode' - a mode for those more prone to motion sickness but
                    still get quality.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added benefits for controlling movement while aiming/shooting
                    enemies. No longer have to be stationary when attacking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Grab inventory items from weapon holsters rather than opening up a
                    menu with your items.
                </li>
                <li>
                    More player-required actions, such as reloading, aiming and
                    shooting, pulling pins on grenades then throwing them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can physically interact with the objects to intuitively work
                    through them, such as puzzles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Aiming also feels a lot more accurate than with a typical
                    controller, and if you want to work on your aim, the shooting
                    gallery is a good way to happily enjoy some low-stakes target
                    practice.
                </li>

                <h2 style="text-align: center; ">The Cons</h2>
                <li>
                    Most cutscenes, for instance, are viewed in a windowed, virtual
                    theater-esque screen in front of you, which is understandable but
                    still a bit of a letdown when it comes to VR.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Other game modes such as 'Mercenaries' is not available - it's only
                    campaign based.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Edited out some dialogue in cutscenes; though even newcomers might
                    notice how some cutscenes feel a tad abrupt in their edits.
                </li>
                <li>Doesn’t include all the content from the original game</li>
                <li>Fire effects and explosions are a little lacklustre</li>
                <li>Female gamers recently suffered from insufficient use of inventory items on chest area</li>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Interactions & Features</h2>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <p>There has been a recent complaint regarding one of the features for using a knife or grendade. This is mainly for women since it was one that <a href="https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-4-vr-design-flaw-female-gamer-discomfort/"> made a post about it</a>, saying that her 'dilemma' had her in certain situations that were intense to accidently punch herself in the chest area, slightly bruising her upper chest. As this issue seems irrelevant to most, it's important to notice the extreme graphic updates. There's been an update to over 4,000 textures within the game that has enhanced the gaming experience. With that, players are now able to interact with and pick up almost anything in the game and inspect it, as prior with the controller it was not available. Something else that may not be instantly noticable is how you are going from third-person gameplay to first-person. This perspective shift allows for the ability to freely run around during combat and much more. But don't be discouraged if you can't be up on your feet with the headset all day, because being seated and playing this game is said to be just as thrilling. The two modes that are set up as a feature make for an all around great experience.</p>
