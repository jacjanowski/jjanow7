        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>

            This first project allows students to become
            familiarized with the Unity environment and have them slowly begin working with importing and creating
            models.
            After cutting out two paper cubes and putting them together, with similarities between them, there are also
            a
            few differences that will take place. Both cubes will focus on having
            various elements on them, such as models, .png background images, C# scripts using OpenWeather API, and text
            fields. The main differences between the two will be regarding models, 8ball mystery sayings, and location
            for
            the use of the API.

        <h4>How to use</h4>

        <p>

            When ready to run program, click the "Play" button
            at the top. Make sure to have a webcam connected. When running, simply point the webcam at one or both of
            the
            paper cubes. Or if you are running this through the app, launch the app and point the camera view at the
            cubes.
            You will see your models come to life!

            <h4>Explanation for models, music, and 8ball sayings</h4>
            <p style="color: rgb(163, 106, 0);">
                For the Classcube (Hawaii), I decided
                to make a Hawaiian themed cube. With this, I had several things to choose from in order to represent
                things from the island. Therefore, some animals like a turtle and dolphin would suffice in
                representing the animals of Hawaii. Some other things that take place on the island are activities like
                surfing! Hence, the surf board model was created. And lastly, when it comes to Hawaii, who isn't going
                to
                relax and enjoy the beach vibes? Therefore, lounge around all afternoon on a beach chair model that was
                grabbed from the web. All while resting underneath a coconut tree of course, which is my fifth model.
                All five models clearly representing what takes place there. Regarding the music, I decided to find a
                nice luau, ukulele type of sound, as this perfectly describes the music that's played there.
            </p>
            <p style="color: purple;">
                For the Mergecube (Texas), I wanted to incorporate a southern/western theme. What Texas reminds me of
                are cowboys, country music, BBQ, and much more that I have yet to experience.
                So, I went ahead of scouted some website that had models that would help best represent Texas for what
                it is. Therefore, I found a cowboy hat to mimic the cowboys, a pecan pie to describe Texas's delicasy
                (my friend from Lubbock, Texas mentioned this, so I guess it must be true lol), and the last model from
                the web, being a horse! Horses are mostly ridden in that
                state and after watching many John Wayne movies with my father, this only made sense to add it in. As
                for the models I created, cacti are all over that state! There aren't any in Chicago (unless you get
                them from Home Depot), so this was fitting in my opinion. And the second model I created for Texas
                is a guitar, emphasizing the traditional southern folk and country genre. And because I made this model,
                I think the best fitting music to go along with this model would be some nice country music, so I added
                this .wav snippet in.
            </p>

            <p>As for the 8ball sayings, for the Classcube, we kept the classic traditional sayings there, so nothing
                was changed. As for the Mergecube, I went ahead and modernized some of the sayings that
                we hear nowadays. Some can be a sort of younger toned responses that people in my age group would say
                (that being teens - lower 20 year olds), something like "100%", signifying a assurance response, as well
                as a negatory response like "There's no way in hell".
