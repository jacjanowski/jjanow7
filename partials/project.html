        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        This first project allows students to become
        familiarized with the Unity environment and have them slowly begin working with importing and creating models.
        After cutting out two paper cubes and putting them together, with similarities between them, there are also a
        few differences that will take place. Both cubes will focus on having
        various elements on them, such as models, .png background images, C# scripts using OpenWeather API, and text
        fields. The main differences between the two will be regarding models, 8ball mystery sayings, and location for
        the use of the API.

        at the top. Make sure to have a webcam connected. When running, simply point the webcam at one or both of the
        paper cubes. You will see your models come to life!

        <h5>Explanation for models, music, and 8ball sayings</h5>
        For the Classcube (Hawaii), I decided
        to make a Hawaiian themed cube. With this, I had several things to choose from in order to represent things from the island. Therefore, some animals like a turtle and dolphin would suffice in 
        representing the animals of Hawaii. Some other things that take place on the island are activities like surfing! Hence, the surf board model was created. And lastly, when it comes to Hawaii, who isn't going to
        relax and enjoy the beach vibes? Therefore, lounge around all afternoon on a beach chair model that was grabbed from the web. All five models clearly representing what takes place there. Regarding the music, I decided to find a 
        nice luau, ukulele type of sound, as this perfectly describes the music that's played there.
