      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        This first project allows students to become familiarized with the Unity
        environment and have them slowly begin working with importing and
        creating models. After cutting out two paper cubes and putting them
        together, with similarities between them, there are also a few
        differences that will take place. Both cubes will focus on having
        various elements on them, such as models, .png background images, C#
        scripts using OpenWeather API, and text fields. The main differences
        between the two will be regarding models, 8ball mystery sayings, and
        location for the use of the API.
      </p>

      <h4>How to use</h4>

      <p>
        When ready to run program, click the "Play" button at the top. Make sure
        to have a webcam connected. When running, simply point the webcam at one
        or both of the paper cubes. Or if you are running this through the app,
        launch the app and point the camera view at the cubes. You will see your
        models come to life!

          Here is a video representation of my project on Unity and also an
          example of the program running on my Android phone. The beginning
          portion is choppy, but the audio is fluent throughout the entirity of
          the video. The second portion of the video will be me running the app
          on my phone. This part is not choppy whatsoever. Video talks about the
          models I chose and explained the reasoning behind what I chose to
          present. I will also talk about the music that was used and how that
          also relates. Both models run simultaneously and individually. The
          part where I run my program begins at <a href="#">4:55.</a>

        <h4>Explanation for models, music, and 8ball sayings</h4>
        <p style="color: rgb(163, 106, 0)">
          For the Classcube (Hawaii), I decided to make a Hawaiian themed cube.
          With this, I had several things to choose from in order to represent
          things from the island. Therefore, some animals like a turtle and
          dolphin would suffice in representing the animals of Hawaii. Some
          other things that take place on the island are activities like
          surfing! Hence, the surf board model was created. And lastly, when it
          comes to Hawaii, who isn't going to relax and enjoy the beach vibes?
          Therefore, lounge around all afternoon on a beach chair model that was
          grabbed from the web. All while resting underneath a coconut tree of
          course, which is my fifth model. All five models clearly representing
          what takes place there. Regarding the music, I decided to find a nice
          luau, ukulele type of sound, as this perfectly describes the music
          that's played there.
        </p>
        <p style="color: purple">
          For the Mergecube (Texas), I wanted to incorporate a southern/western
          theme. What Texas reminds me of are cowboys, country music, BBQ, and
          much more that I have yet to experience. So, I went ahead of scouted
          some website that had models that would help best represent Texas for
          what it is. Therefore, I found a cowboy hat to mimic the cowboys, a
          pecan pie to describe Texas's delicasy (my friend from Lubbock, Texas
          mentioned this, so I guess it must be true lol), and the last model
          from the web, being a horse! Horses are mostly ridden in that state
          and after watching many John Wayne movies with my father, this only
          made sense to add it in. As for the models I created, cacti are all
          over that state! There aren't any in Chicago (unless you get them from
          Home Depot), so this was fitting in my opinion. And the second model I
          created for Texas is a guitar, emphasizing the traditional southern
          folk and country genre. And because I made this model, I think the
          best fitting music to go along with this model would be some nice
          country music, so I added this .wav snippet in.
        </p>

        <p>
          As for the 8ball sayings, for the Classcube, we kept the classic
          traditional sayings there, so nothing was changed. As for the
          Mergecube, I went ahead and modernized some of the sayings that we
          hear nowadays. Some can be a sort of younger toned responses that
          people in my age group would say (that being teens - lower 20 year
          olds), something like "100%", signifying a assurance response, as well
          as a negatory response like "There's no way in hell".
